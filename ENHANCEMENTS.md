## Contact Form Integration

### Features Added
- **Interactive Contact Form**: Users can now send messages directly through the website
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validates required fields and email format
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during form submission
- **Success/Error Handling**: Clear status messages for users
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to mailto links in production if API is unavailable

### Technical Implementation
- **Development**: Uses proxy to backend at `http://localhost:3000/api/contact`
- **Production**: Configurable to use external form services (like Formspree) or fallback to email
- **Backend**: Express.js endpoint with validation and logging
- **Frontend**: TypeScript with reactive states and error handling

### Usage
1. **Development**: Run `./dev-start.sh` to start both backend and frontend
2. **Production**: Update the API endpoint in `Contact.svelte` to your preferred service

## Enhanced About Section

### Improvements Made
- **Personal Narrative**: Added storytelling elements that showcase personality and passion
- **Technical Philosophy**: Clear explanation of approaches to software development
- **Journey-focused**: Explains what drives the developer and their unique perspective
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Better organization with engaging headers and sections
- **Emotional Connection**: More relatable content that helps visitors connect with the person behind the code

### Key Additions
- Origin story and motivation
- Technical philosophy and values

- Challenge-oriented attitude

## Development Workflow

### New Scripts
- `dev-start.sh`: Starts both backend and frontend in development mode
- `npm run build`: Builds the static site for deployment
- Enhanced Vite config with API proxy for seamless development

### File Structure
